### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell - Learn CSS Grid the easy way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - A wonderful video about CSS Grid that was immensely helpful for me without getting overwhelmed by all the properties that come with it.
- [Omatsuri](https://omatsuri.app/) - Omatsuri has dozens of really useful tools, especially for generating gradients, shades, tints etc. I started using this website recently and it has made it much easier for me to work with beautiful color palettes.
